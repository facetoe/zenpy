API Objects
===========

The Zenpy API objects are automatically generated using the script
`gen_classes.py` in the `tools` directory based on the specification found in
the `specification` directory. The generated Python objects are a one to one
mapping with the API, so any attribute returned by the API should be present
in the Python object.

Instantiating Objects
---------------------

When creating objects, any keyword argument can be passed to the constructor
and it will become an attribute of that object. For example the code:

::

    user = User(name='Jim', email='jim@jim.com')

Will create a `User` object with the name and email fields set.

Object Properties
-----------------

Many attributes are implemented as `properties`. Any attribute that holds an
id is also implemented as a `property` which returns the object associated
with that id. For example, the `Ticket` object has two related attributes:
`assignee` and `assignee_id`. When the `assignee` attribute is accessed,
Zenpy first attempts to locate the related `User` in the `User` cache and if
it cannot be found will generate and execute an API call to retrieve,
instantiate, cache and return the object. Accessing the `assignee_id`
attribute simply returns the id.

The following attributes are also implemented as `properties`:

+--------------------+----------------------------+
| **Attribute Type** | **Returns**                |
+--------------------+----------------------------+
| dict               | object the dict represents |
+--------------------+----------------------------+
| date string        | Python datetime object     |
+--------------------+----------------------------+
| list of id's       | List of objects            |
+--------------------+----------------------------+


It is important to note that most property setters throw away all information
except for the id. This is because Zendesk only expects the id, so any
modifications made to the object will not be persisted automatically.

For example, the following `Ticket`::

    ticket = Ticket(subject='stuffs', description='stuff stuff stuff')
    user = User(id=10, name='Jim', email='jim@jim.com')
    ticket.assignee = user

Will be serialized as::

    {
        "description": "stuff stuff stuff",
        "assignee_id": 10,
        "subject": "stuffs"
    }


Object Serialization
--------------------

Before API objects are sent to Zendesk (eg for creation/updates), they are
serialized into JSON once again. This is done recursively and any nested
objects will be serialized as well. One handy side effect of how this is done
is it is possible to set any arbitrary attribute on an API object and it will
be serialized and sent to Zendesk.

For example the object::

    user = User(name='Jim', email='jim@jim.com')
    user.some_thing = 100

Will be serialized as::

    {
        "email": "jim@jim.com",
        "some_thing": 100,
        "name": "Jim"
    }


A more useful example might be adding a comment to a ticket. Usually the
`Ticket` object does not have a `comment` attribute, however if we add one it
will be correctly serialized, sent to Zendesk and added to the specified
ticket.

For example, after adding the `comment` attribute containing a `Comment`
object::

    ticket.comment = Comment(body="I am a private comment", public=False)

the serialized ticket will include the additional information::

    {
        "description": "I am a test ticket",
        "subject": "Testing",

        ...snip...
        "comment": {
        "public": false,
        "body": "I am a private comment"
        }
    }


Api Object Modifications
------------------------

When updating an object, only the id and those attributes that have been
modified will be sent to Zendesk. For example, the following code will only
print the user's id.

.. code:: python

    user = zenpy_client.users.me()
    print(user.to_dict(serialize=True))

Whereas the following will also include the name attribute, as it has been
modified:

.. code:: python

    user = zenpy_client.users.me()
    user.name = "Batman"
    print(user.to_dict(serialize=True))

This is also true of attributes of objects that are lists or dicts, however
the implementation might lead to some surprises. Consider the following:

.. code:: python

    ticket = zenpy_client.tickets(id=1)
    ticket.custom_fields[0]['value'] = 'I am modified'
    print(ticket.to_dict(serialize=True))

Here we modify the first element of the custom_fields list. How can Zenpy know
that this has happened? The answer is proxy objects:

.. code:: python

    print(type(ticket.custom_fields))
    >> <class 'zenpy.lib.proxy.ProxyList'>

    print(type(ticket.custom_fields[0]))
    >> <class 'zenpy.lib.proxy.ProxyDict'>

The way this works is when an element is retrieved from a list, it checks
whether or not it is a list or dict. If it is, then the list or dict is
wrapped in a Proxy class which executes a callback on modification so that the
parent knows it has been modified. As a result, we can detect changes to lists
or dicts and properly update Zendesk when they occur.
